The VCF Validation Suite is a set of programs that you can download and {\bfseries{execute in your computer}} using a terminal (called "{}\mbox{[}command prompt\mbox{]}(https\+://en.\+wikipedia.\+org/wiki/\+Cmd.\+exe)"{} on Windows, and "{}terminal"{} or "{}console"{} in Linux and mac\+OS).

You can download all three programs ({\ttfamily vcf\+\_\+validator}, {\ttfamily vcf\+\_\+debugulator} and {\ttfamily vcf\+\_\+assembly\+\_\+checker}) from \href{https://github.com/EBIvariation/vcf-validator/releases}{\texttt{ the releases page}}. Note that the tools are available for Linux, mac\+OS and Windows.

You may particularly be interested in the {\ttfamily vcf\+\_\+validator} which checks compliance with the \href{https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf}{\texttt{ VCF specification}}.

Read the \href{https://github.com/EBIvariation/vcf-validator/blob/master/README.md\#run}{\texttt{ README.\+md}} for the instructions on how to run these tools. Running the tools with {\ttfamily -\/-\/help} will also briefly explain the available parameters.
